## Changelog

* Version 6.2.0

	* Features
		* xmhf-64: initial commit, copied from xmhf
		* xmhf-64: fix compile errors found in high GCC version
		* xmhf-64: support running XMHF in 64-bit mode
		* xmhf-64: support continuous integration testing
		* xmhf-64: support running XMHF in QEMU
		* xmhf-64: support running XMHF with modern guest operating systems
		* xmhf-64: support running guests that use PAE paging
		* xmhf-64: provide ``pal_demo``, which compiles TrustVisor PALs in
		  Windows and Linux, without using linker scripts
		* xmhf-64: decrease compilation artifact size (e.g. object files)
		* xmhf-64: support optimized compile (e.g. ``-O3``)
		* xmhf-64: support DMAP in Intel
		* xmhf-64: allow the guest OS to change MTRR
		* xmhf-64: support x2APIC
		* xmhf-64: support Intel microcode update

	* Logic Fixes
		* xmhf-64: check `grube820list_numentries` in `dealwithE820()` to
		  prevent possible buffer overflow
		* xmhf-64: fix Makefile dependencies problems
		* xmhf-64: fix unsigned overflow in `udelay()`. This bug causes sleep
		  to be shorter than expected
		* xmhf-64: fix the CR0 intercept handler
		* xmhf-64: fix WRMSR intercept handler when MSR comes from
		  `vmx_msr_area_msrs`. This bug leads to unexpected values read by the
		  guest
		* xmhf-64: block guests' access to x2APIC. This bug may allow guests to
		  to send INIT to a CPU
		* xmhf-64: fix incorrect assert in hpt.c for long mode paging. This bug
		  is on a code path that is likely unused by 32-bit guests
		* xmhf-64: fix logic in NMI quiesce handling. This bug can cause
		  deadlock and lose of guest NMIs
		* xmhf-64: fix the problem that `HALT()` does not halt forever. This
		  bug can cause troubles during debugging
		* xmhf-64: fix the problem that the last entry of E820 is dropped
		* xmhf-64: unset CR4.VMXE, which is incorrectly set
		* xmhf-64: fix logic in booting, which causes problems for single CPU
		  machines
		* xmhf-64: fix guest initial state (e.g. DX, CR0, ...)
		* xmhf-64: truncate RSP in `_vmx_int15_handleintercept()`
		* xmhf-64: fix incorrect assumption about default MTRR type. This bug
		  causes strange cache errors in Windows 10
		* xmhf-64: block guests' change to MTRRs. This bug allows guests to
		  change host's memory cache settings
		* xmhf-64: block guest microcode update. This bug allows guests to
		  update microcode arbitrarily
		* xmhf-64: fix NULL pointer reference in the VGA driver. This bug is on
		  a code path that only happens when debugging
		* xmhf-64: fix incorrect use of .fill in `xmhf_xcphandler_idt_start()`.
		  This bug leads to less area allocated for IDT than expected
		* xmhf-64: remove two unused nmm functions that may contain bugs
