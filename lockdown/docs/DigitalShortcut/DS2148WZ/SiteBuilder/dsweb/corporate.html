                               With more than 20 years of experience in microcontroller and digital design fields,
                               knowing a huge variety of processors, we came to the conclusion that now is the
                               time for significant overhaul of the embedded world. The advent of inexpensive ARM based
                               micros with an array of versatile peripherals dwarfed the old designs overnight. The new
                               one can be less expensive and delivers the execution speed at least by one order
                               of magnitude faster. The power of LPC2148 (60MHz ARM7 32-bit CPU) with built-in UARTs,
                               ISP, I2C, PWM, RTC, ADCs, DACs and more than 40 General Purpose IOs brings a
                               totally new level of performance to the embedded control field. Available memory resources
                               (both Flash and RAM) are so vast that good, ye olde 8051 looks like a midget when compared.
                               There is no need for tricks like bank switching and extensive assembly patching.
                               Without any hesitation you can move to C-only programming and feel a lot of extra "breathing space".<br>
                               &#149 Our mission is to deliver affordable, but versatile and powerful easy-to-use design
                               and development platforms for embedded projects, specially suitable for Industrial Ethernet,
                               Internet-enabled devices and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) applications.<br>
                               &#149 Our products are ready to be used out of the box, on day one. <br>
                               &#149 We aim to reduce startup effort, time to market and development cost.<br>
                               &#149 By using our platforms you can get immediate USB and Ethernet connectivity.<br>
                               &#149 We are enthusiasts of open source community and we often use available solutions.<br>
                               &#149 The hardware is complemented by a free downloadable GNU ARM toolchain (C, C++ compilers, Linker) and
                               FlashLoader utility.<br>
                               &#149 In download section of this website we present several application examples tailored
                               to our boards and ready to be used as a reference or even starting point of your project.
                               They include "startup.c" addressing (always tricky) processor  initialization/configuration
                               issues and a "makefile" responsible for compilation and linking setup.<br>
                               &#149 We want to deliver smart and easy-to-use "shortcut solutions" for the high-tech embedded world.<br>
