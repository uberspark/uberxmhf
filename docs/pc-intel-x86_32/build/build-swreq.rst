Software Requirements and Dependencies
======================================

The uberSpark development and verification framework is required to 
verify the micro-hypervisor and and build the micro-hypervisor binaries. 
It is available at: `https://uberspark.org <https://uberspark.org>`_\ ). 

..  note::
    These tools require a 64-bit environment, so the micro-hypervisor cannot 
    be built on the ``target`` platform where it is installed and runs.
