This directory contains an extremely stripped down libc.
Primarily, it contains the mem*() and str*() functions
that are part of string.h.

The intention is to provide basic libc computational support
for hypervisor internals, extremely minimized PALs, and
other environments where TCB / code size is a priority, and
using 'newlib' constitues too much TCB / code size.

A lot of headers were taken from FreeBSD 9.  Logic from FreeBSD to
support a multitude of different architectures was removed.  Hence
files include/sys/i386_*.  These were originally machine/* in FreeBSD.
