/*
	note on the two different types of PCI config space access methods
	(unfortunately only a fraction of this is in the PCI specs...
		maybe that is why the specs. are not public :p)

	type-1 accesses:

	this method uses two standard PCI I/O ports to initiate a
	configuration cycle. The type of cycle is determined by the
	host-bridge device based on the devices primary bus number.
	if the configuration bus number matches the primary bus number then a
	type 0 configuration cycle occurs. otherwise a type 1 cycle is generated.
	this is all transparent to the user. more on type 0 and type 1 cycles
	later...

	the two ports used for type-1 accesses are the
	PCI_CONFIG_ADDR_PORT (0xCF8) and PCI_CONFIG_DATA_PORT (0xCFC).

	CF8h, 32-bit, r/w
	bits  0-7  	PCI conf. space index to read/write at CFCh
    		8-15  device and function
    		16-23 bus
  			24-27	extended 4-bits of PCI conf. space index for PCIe conf. space accesses
	     	31  	set to enable the PCI bus configuration space

	CFCh, 32-bit, r/w
	bits  0-31  the PCI conf. space index specified in CF8h
           		can be accessed here for reads and writes.


	type-2 accesses:

	this method uses three standard PCI I/O ports to initiate a
	configuration cycle.

	the three ports used for type-2 accesses are the
	PCI_CONFIG_ADDR_PORT (0xCF8), PCI_CONFIG_FORWARD_PORT (0xCFA), and
	PCI_CONFIG_BASE_PORT (0xC000).

	CF8h, 8-bit, r/w
	bits	0			reserved and set to 0
				1-3		3-bit function
				4-7		reserved all set to 1s

	CFAh, 8-bit, r/w
	bits	0-7 	8-bit bus

	the function and bus are sent out to PCI_CONFIG_ADDR_PORT and
	PCI_CONFIG_FORWARD_PORT respectively as above, this is followed
	by a read or write to the i/o port that is constructed as follows:

	32-bit i/o port to read/write required PCI conf. space index (reg) for device (dev)
	= (PCI_CONFIG_BASE_PORT | (dev << 8) | reg)

	Note that type-1 accesses can address 256bytes (regular PCI) or
	4096bytes (PCIe) of PCI conf.	space. However, type-2 is limited to only
	256bytes.

	The mechanism supported (type-1 or type-2) depends on the PCI chipset
	implementation. All systems manufactured after 2001 seem to support
	type-1 (ref: Linux Kernel), so we detect if it supports type-1 and go
	with that, else halt!

	Some info on PCI configuration cycles (thankfully
	this is in the PCI spec. :p)

	Type 0 PCI Configuration cycles do not contain a bus number and these
	are interpreted by all devices as being for PCI configuration addresses on
	this PCI bus. Bits 31:11 of the Type 0 configuraration cycles are treated as
	the device select field.

	Type 1 PCI Configuration cycles contain a PCI bus number and this type of
	configuration cycle is ignored by all PCI devices except the PCI-PCI bridges.
	All of the PCI-PCI Bridges seeing Type 1 configuration cycles may choose to
	pass them to the PCI buses downstream of themselves. Whether the PCI-PCI
	Bridge ignores the Type 1 configuration cycle or passes it onto the downstream
	PCI bus depends on how the PCI-PCI Bridge has been configured. Every
	PCI-PCI bridge has a primary bus interface number and a secondary bus
	interface number. The primary bus interface being the one nearest the CPU
	and the secondary bus interface being the one furthest away.
	Each PCI-PCI Bridge also has a subordinate bus number and this is the
	maximum bus number of all the PCI buses that are bridged beyond the
	secondary bus interface. Or to put it another way, the subordinate bus
	number is the highest numbered PCI bus downstream of the PCI-PCI bridge.

	When the PCI-PCI bridge sees a Type 1 PCI configuration cycle it does one of
	the following things:

  *Ignore it if the bus number specified is not in between the bridge's
  secondary bus number and subordinate bus number (inclusive),

  *Convert it to a Type 0 configuration command if the bus number specified
  matches the secondary bus number of the bridge,

  *Pass it onto the secondary bus interface unchanged if the bus number
  specified is greater than the secondary bus number and less than or equal
	to the subordinate bus number

	geronimo...
