This repository includes several sub-projects, many of which use code
from multiple sources, under different licenses. The AUTHORITATIVE
licenses and conditions are in file-headers and notices in the
individual sub-projects.

For CONVENIENCE, we here attempt to summarize the state of
licensing for this repository.

Our view on licensing
=====================

Our preference is for permissive licenses allowing binary
distribution, though possibly requiring attribution. This is motivated
by several factors:

1. This project is partially sponsored with government funding. For
this reason it makes sense to make it a "public good" with very few
restrictions.

2. This project is partially sponsored by independent corporations. We
would like them to be able to view and use the code without fear of
legal entanglements.

3. We believe that placing fewer restrictions on this code will help
it be used more widely and have greater impact.

For these reasons, code generated specifically for this project is
placed under a BSD-style license, as in the accompanying [LICENSE](LICENSE)
file.

We have attempted to minimize the incorporation of third party code
that would place additional restrictions on how our code is used.  We
currently use some GPL code, though we continue to seek non-GPL
alternatives. See below for more details.

Unmodified distribution
=======================

All software in this repository is under some form of open source
license. You are free to use and distribute the unmodified source code.

Derived works
=============

Most of the source licenses have some form of attribution clause
requiring that any modifications leave the copyright and license
information place, and that distributed binaries be accompanied with
that copyright and license information.

We attempt to avoid GPL-style licenses requiring that derived works
also be under GPL-style licenses. However, there is currently some GPL
code in this repository. See below.

Binary distribution
===================

There is currently some GPL-licensed code in this repository. See below.

GPL status of sub-projects
==========================

* xmhf:
  No GPL.

	* libbaremetal:
  	  No GPL.

	* third-party:
      No GPL.

* trustvisor:
  No GPL.

	* tee-sdk:
  	  hypapps/trustvisor/tee-sdk/ports/newlib is GPLv2. Therefore, PALs 
	  that link with newlib are necessarily GPLv2, including some of the 
	  examples in hypapps/trustvisor/tee-sdk/examples.

* lockdown:
  The lockdown hypervisor itself is not GPL. Some third-party
  tools may be, though. See lockdown/src/COPYING for a summary.

* tools:
  No GPL.

Third party code in repository history
======================================

We attempt to summarize third-party code and their respective
licenses that appear somewhere in the history of this repository.
Note that these are no longer present in a checkout of the current
HEAD of the repository, but git always retrieves the exhaustive history.

* OSLO (GPLv2), 
* Putty (MIT license), 
* OpenSSH (BSD), 
* Linux kernel (GPLv2), 
* Xen (GPLv2)
* Google Protocol Buffers (Apache 2.0)
* amtterm (GPLv2) (NOTE: A copy of amtterm's source code was accidentally 
  updated with our own headers in a now-defunct demo subdirectory of 
  TrustVisor.  This was in error.)
* tlsf_malloc (special LGPL)

Third party code in current HEAD as of 2013-10-21
=================================================

We attempt to summarize third-party code and their respective
license that appear in the current repository HEAD.

* libtommath (WTFPL)
* libtomcrypto (WTFPL)
* Tboot (BSD-style)
* OpenSSL (BSD-style), 
* newlib (GPL)
* tlsf.baisoku.org (public domain)

Lockdown-specific:

* RTFM Inc ssldump (http://www.rtfm.com/ssldump/) (BSD)
* LPCUSB, an USB device driver for LPC microcontrollers  (BSD)
* LPC ARM processor runtime environment (no restrictions)
* Generic ARM CRC module by Gary S. Brown (no restrictions)

Notices that must be reproduced
===============================

We attempt to catalogue license headers in source files that are
required to be included in any binary-only distribution (i.e., typical
BSD-style requirement):

Automatically extracted
-----------------------

The following are automatically extracted headers from files with
FreeBSD-style C-style license header comments starting with `/*-` (note
the dash).  One way to identify such files: `egrep -rl '^\/\*-' >
filelist.txt` One way to do most of the heavy lifting (w/ a few false
positives): 

    for i in `cat filelist.txt`; do \
        perl -n -e 'print "$_" if /\/\*-/ .. /\*\//;' $i; \
    done
